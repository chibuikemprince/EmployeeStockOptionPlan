# Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) Smart Contract

The Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) Smart Contract is a decentralized application that allows companies to manage their employee stock options using blockchain technology. The ESOP Smart Contract allows companies to transfer stock options to employees, set up vesting schedules, and manage stock option exercises, all through a secure and transparent platform.

## Technical Overview

The ESOP Smart Contract is built using Solidity, a smart contract programming language that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The contract includes the following functionality:

- Employee stock option transfers
- Employee stock option grants
- Vesting schedule management
- Exercise of stock options

The contract is designed to be secure and transparent, with all stock option transfers and exercises recorded on the blockchain for public verification.

The EmployeeStockOptionPlan smart contract is a decentralized application built using Solidity. Its main purpose is to allow companies to manage their employee stock options using blockchain technology. The contract allows for the granting, transfer, and vesting of employee stock options, as well as the exercise of vested options.

## Design Decisions
The contract was designed with security and transparency in mind. Therefore, every state change made on the contract is recorded on the blockchain. Also, the contract was designed to enforce specific rules on the employee stock options granted to ensure that they are given to the right person, at the right time, under the right conditions.

## Architecture
The contract is divided into five components:

Ownership contract: This is responsible for granting the owner absolute control over the contract, including the ability to transfer ownership.
Governance contract: This includes a set of functions that enable the contract owner to manage governance-related decisions and allows the owner to change contract parameters.

Employee contract: This component is responsible for handling all employee-related functions, such as granting, transferring, and vesting of employee stock options.

Utility contract: This works with the Employee contract and performs specific tasks, including token vesting and the restriction of employee stock option exercise to within the vesting period.

ERC20 contract: This is a standard Ethereum token contract that is used as the underlying asset of the employee stock options.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask or Mist
- Access to an Ethereum testnet or the Ethereum mainnet

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine

### Usage

1. Compile the smart contract
